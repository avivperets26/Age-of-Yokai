I've included here a few examples of other asset sets I've created which go along with this tile set:

"Painted 2D Location Hexes: Medieval-Fantasy"    - http://u3d.as/oZ7
"Painted 2D Terrain Hexes: Cold Lands"           - http://u3d.as/wkt
"Painted 2D Terrain Hexes: Deserts"              - http://u3d.as/KZb
"Painted 2D Terrain Hexes: Tropics and Wetlands" - http://u3d.as/12zZ
"Painted 2D Terrain Hexes: Volcanic Wastes"      - (no link yet- but it'll be on the store when you can read this.)

Feel free to use any of these sample tiles as-is. If you think they're cool and want more, check out the sets on the Unity Asset Store at the links above!
