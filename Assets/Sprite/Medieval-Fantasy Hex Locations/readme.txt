Description:
This is a set of lovingly hand-painted 2D medieval-fantasy hex location tiles suitable for an RPG overworld, a strategy game, or boardgame-like visuals. 

- expands upon my "Terrain Hexes: Basic Set" for those interested in making medieval-fantasy games
- 66 hex tiles (25 or so unique location types, some on different terrain types, some with multiple variations)  
- painted at 256x384 pixels so that towers, mountains, and trees can overlap the tiles behind 
- includes 85 road tiles for all possible permutations of hex grid roads (some of single variation, some of two)
- includes 117 "decor" sprites which can be placed on any background terrain texture (these include versions of the hex locations with the underlying terrain removed)

Location types included: 
- farmland (on plains)
- village (on plains, dirt; includes small variation)
- basic castle (on plains, dirt)
- castle variations, some ruined (on mountains, marsh, dirt)
- pyramids & ruins (in desert)
- oasis (in desert)
- graveyard (in marsh)
- smithy (on dirt, plains)
- inn (on dirt, plains)
- forester's cabin (in the forest, of course)
- walled city (on dirt, plains)
- mines (in mountains, hills)
- stonehenge (in dirt, plains)
- temple (on plains, dirt)
- ruined temple (on plains, dirt)
- halfling village
- necromancer's tower
- lava-filled cave
- elven lodge

Hex tiles are included as individual pngs. Roads are included as individual pngs. 

If you would like any additional variations or tile types, send me an email to dgbaumgart@gmail.com and I'll see if I can add it to the set; it may seem like a bit of a random selection right now, but I was using games like Warlords and Heroes of Might and Magic as a rough guide as to what sort of locations to include. There's tons of room for expansion of course, though that depends on if this is something people are interested in seeing more of.


More on roads:

These have been named in the following format: hexRoad-[direction bit key]-[variation number].

The direction bit key gives a zero or one depending on if the road attaches to that direction in the order of NORTHWEST, NORTHEAST, EAST, SOUTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, WEST. (Think of it like a clock.) So, for example, a straight east-west road would be "001001", while a t-junction connection to West, East, and Southwest would be "001011". The variation number is included so that every piece of road of a certain type and direction doesn't look exactly the same. For most, there's only a 00, but some of the roads of a 01 variation as well. (There were a LOT of road pieces for these, let me tell you, so I didn't do many variations.)

If this is giving you trouble, feel free to drop me an email and I'll try to do a better job explaining it. Or, likely, it's simple enough to just look at the images and figure it out.


Usage:

These hexagonal terrain tiles are intended to be drawn so that tiles in rows lower on the screen are drawn overtop of tiles in rows higher on the screen. This will ensure that trees, hills, and mountains will appear to stand out. There's also an underground layer for land, water, and void that you can draw to give the impression of additional depth to your game.

Future:

As noted, if there's interest, I'm always interested in drawing more tiles and incidental assets. Send me an email and I'll see what I can do.
