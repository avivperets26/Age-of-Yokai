Description:
This is a set of lovingly hand-painted 2D medieval-fantasy location suitable for an RPG overworld, a strategy game, or boardgame-like visuals. 

- expands upon my "Terrain Tiles: Basic Set" for those interested in making medieval-fantasy games
- 66 tiles (25 unique location types, some on different terrain types, some with multiple variations)  
- painted at 256x384 pixels so that towers, mountains, and trees can overlap the tiles behind 
- can be used in a square grid or staggered faux-hex style grid 
- includes 32 road tiles (16 direction types with 2-4 variations per type)
- includes 117 "decor" sprites which can be placed on any background terrain texture (these include versions of the hex locations with the underlying terrain removed)

Location types included: 
- farmland (on plains)
- village (on plains, dirt)
- basic castle (on plains, dirt)
- castle variations, some ruined (on mountains, marsh, dirt)
- pyramids & ruins (in desert)
- oasis (in desert)
- graveyard (in marsh)
- smithy (on dirt, plains)
- inn (on dirt, plains)
- forester's cabin (in the forest, of course)
- walled city (on dirt, plains)
- mines (in mountains, hills)
- stonehenge (in dirt, plains)
- temple (on plains, dirt)
- a ruined temple (on plains, dirt)
- halfling village
- necromancer's tower
- lava-filled cave
- elven lodge

Tiles are included as individual pngs. Roads are included as individual pngs and a tilesheet. 

If you would like any additional variations or tile types, send me an email to dgbaumgart@gmail.com and I'll see if I can add it to the set; it may seem like a bit of a random selection right now, but I was using games like Warlords and Heroes of Might and Magic as a rough guide as to what sort of locations to include. There's tons of room for expansion of course, though that depends on if this is something people are interested in seeing more of.


More on roads:

These have been named in the following format: [road piece type][direction bit key][variation number]. The road piece type is straightforward. The direction bit key gives a zero or one depending on if the road attaches to that direction in the order of NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST. So, for example, a straight east-west road would be "0011", while a t-junction connection to West, East, and South would be "0111". The variation number is included so that every piece of road of a certain type and direction doesn't look exactly the same.

If this is giving you trouble, feel free to drop me an email and I'll try to do a better job explaining it. Or, likely, it's simple enough to just look at the images and figure it out.


Usage:

These square-format terrain tiles are intended to be drawn so that tiles in rows lower on the screen are drawn overtop of tiles in rows higher on the screen. This will ensure that trees, hills, and mountains will appear to stand out. You can make this a square grid or a staggered square grid to get a hex-grid like effect. NOTE: The roads are NOT build to work for a staggered hex-grid style  map. If this is getting in your way, drop me an email and I'll help you out.

Future:

As noted, if there's interest, I'm always interested in drawing more tiles.
