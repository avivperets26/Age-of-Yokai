Last Update: v1.3 in January 2018

Description:
This is a set of lovingly hand-painted 2D terrain tiles suitable for an overworld, a strategy game, or boardgame-like visuals. 
- 13 biomes x 4 variations = 52 tiles total 
- painted at 256x384 pixels so that trees, hills, and mountains can overlap the tiles behind 
- can be used in a square grid or staggered faux-hex style grid 
- includes 34 alpha-background decor objects like trees, rocks, and grass

Terrain types included: 
- grassy plains 
- forest 
- water 
- desert dunes 
- marshland 
- snow-capped mountains
- hills
- dirt
- woodland
- highland
- shrubland
- base (generic empty tiles)
- void (stars)


Usage:
These square-format terrain tiles are intended to be drawn so that tiles in rows lower on the screen are drawn overtop of tiles in rows higher on the screen. This will ensure that trees, hills, and mountains will appear to stand out. You can make this a square grid or a staggered square grid to get a hex-grid like effect.

Future:
If these prove popular, I may wish to do further tiles to add to this set, and further types of tilesets like this. I do have a passion for terrain tiles, after all. So drop me a line if you've got something particular in mind.
